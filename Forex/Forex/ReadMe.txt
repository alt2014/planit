To do:

Change it to not a table view (oops!)

Allow users to choose a country from a drop down menu
	Full list of countries/codes in JSON: http://openexchangerates.org/api/currencies.json

Allow users to type in a number and automatically convert it to the appropriate amount in the second currency

Allow the user to flip the placement of the currencies (i.e. button mapped which switches countryCode1 and countryCode2 in the Currency Class)
